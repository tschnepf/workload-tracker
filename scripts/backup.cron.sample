# Notes:
# - The script uses docker-compose.yml + docker-compose.prod.yml and runs the backup inside the backend container.
# - Retention defaults can be overridden via env vars before the command:
#   DAILY_KEEP=10 WEEKLY_KEEP=6 MONTHLY_KEEP=18 cd /path/to/workload-tracker && bash scripts/backup.sh daily
# - Ensure your ./backups directory exists and is bind-mounted in docker-compose.prod.yml.
