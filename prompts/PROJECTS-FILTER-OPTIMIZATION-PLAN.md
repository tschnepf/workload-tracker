# Projects Page Filter Optimization Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Current Scope

## üìä **OBJECTIVE**
Replace client-side assignment counting and deliverable filtering with optimized backend filter metadata endpoint to eliminate performance lag on Projects page.

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- ‚úÖ Projects page loads without noticeable lag
- ‚úÖ All existing filters work correctly ("Active - No Dates", "No Assignments", status filters)
- ‚úÖ "Active - No Dates" filter properly excludes projects with future deliverable dates
- ‚úÖ Assignment counting uses single backend API call instead of N+1 pattern
- ‚úÖ Maintains all existing functionality with improved performance
- ‚úÖ No regressions in search, sorting, or other filter functionality

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**
```
Current (Problematic):
Frontend loads ALL assignments ‚Üí Client-side counting ‚Üí Filter application

Optimized (Target):
Backend computes filter metadata ‚Üí Single API response ‚Üí Direct filter application
```

## ‚úÖ **WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS (SIMPLIFIED)**

### **Phase 1 Essentials:**
1. **Add filter metadata ViewSet action** (simple)
2. **Create React hook for metadata** (follows existing patterns)
3. **Replace assignment counting logic** (straightforward swap)
4. **Add cache invalidation** (one line in existing mutations)

### **Nice-to-Haves:**
1. **Database indexes** (for better performance)
2. **Better error boundaries** (for robustness)
3. **Performance monitoring** (for metrics)

### **Field Name Issue (The Real One):**
- **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:** `assignments__is_active` instead of `assignments__isActive` in ORM queries
- **Everything else:** Serializers handle camelCase transformation automatically ‚úÖ

       def filter_metadata(self, request):
           """Get optimized filter metadata for all projects"""
           today = timezone.now().date()
           
           # ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Use correct field name assignments__is_active (not isActive)
           projects_data = Project.objects.filter(is_active=True).annotate(
               assignment_count=Count(
                   'assignments',
                   filter=Q(assignments__is_active=True),  # ‚úÖ CORRECT field name
                   distinct=True
               ),
               has_future_deliverables=Exists(
                   Deliverable.objects.filter(
                       project=OuterRef('pk'),
                       date__gt=today,
                       date__isnull=False
                   )
               )
           ).values('id', 'assignment_count', 'has_future_deliverables', 'status')
           
           # Serializer will handle camelCase transformation automatically
           return Response({
               'projectFilters': {  # Will become camelCase in response
                   str(p['id']): {
                       'assignmentCount': p['assignment_count'],
                       'hasFutureDeliverables': p['has_future_deliverables'],
                       'status': p['status']
                   }
                   for p in projects_data
               }
           })
   ```

2. **Endpoint will be accessible at:** `/api/projects/filter_metadata/` (DRF action URL pattern)
3. **Follow existing ViewSet patterns** - no standalone view needed
4. **Use existing permissions** from ProjectViewSet
5. **Basic error handling** with try/catch (circuit breaker optional)

PERFORMANCE VALIDATION:

### **STEP 2: Frontend API Integration**

#### **Step 2.1: Create Frontend API Method**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Add new API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts for fetching project filter metadata.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add to projectsApi object:
   getFilterMetadata: () => Promise<ProjectFilterMetadataResponse>
2. Create TypeScript interface:
   interface ProjectFilterMetadataResponse {
     project_filters: {
       [projectId: string]: {
         assignment_count: number;
         has_future_deliverables: boolean;
         status: string;
       }
     }
   }
3. Add interface to frontend/src/types/models.ts

```

#### **Step 2.2: Create React Hook for Filter Metadata with Circuit Breaker**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create a custom React hook for managing project filter metadata state with circuit breaker pattern.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create frontend/src/hooks/useProjectFilterMetadata.ts
2. **CIRCUIT BREAKER IMPLEMENTATION:**
   ```typescript
   // Add to frontend/src/hooks/useProjectFilterMetadata.ts
   const useProjectFilterMetadata = () => {
     return useQuery(
       ['projectFilterMetadata'], 
       projectsApi.getFilterMetadata,
       {
         retry: (failureCount, error) => {
           // Implement exponential backoff
           if (failureCount > 3) return false
           return !error.message.includes('Circuit breaker')
         },
         retryDelay: attemptIndex => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000),
         fallbackData: null, // Graceful degradation
         staleTime: 30000, // 30 seconds
         keepPreviousData: true,
         onError: (error) => {
           console.warn('Filter metadata failed, falling back to legacy system:', error)
         }
       }
     )
   }
   ```

3. Hook should provide:
   - filterMetadata state (initially null)
   - loading state (boolean)
   - error state (string | null)
   - refetch function for manual updates
   - isUsingFallback flag for debugging
4. Use React Query pattern similar to existing hooks (useProjects, usePeople)
5. Include smart cache invalidation strategy
6. Handle loading states with graceful degradation
7. Include comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Follow existing hook patterns in the codebase
- Use React Query for caching and state management
- Set appropriate stale time (30 seconds) with keepPreviousData
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff
- Export hook with proper TypeScript types
- Add performance timing logging

CACHE INVALIDATION SLAs:
- **Eventual Consistency Window**: 30 seconds maximum
- **Critical Operations**: Assignment/deliverable CRUD must invalidate cache within 5 seconds
- **Batch Operations**: Bulk updates get 60-second consistency window
- **Failure Recovery**: Cache misses must fallback to live queries with < 2x response time

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Hook compiles without errors
- Loading states work correctly
- Error handling functions properly with fallback
- Cache invalidation works when data changes
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- Performance improvement measurable (>50% faster)

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Integrate the new filter metadata hook into ProjectsList.tsx component with proper memory management.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **MEMORY LEAK PREVENTION:**
   ```typescript
   // FIXED: Proper cleanup in ProjectsList component
   const ProjectsList = () => {
     // Add cleanup for parallel systems
     useEffect(() => {
       return () => {
         // Cleanup both old and new filter systems
         queryClient.removeQueries(['assignmentCounts'])
         queryClient.removeQueries(['projectFilterMetadata'])
       }
     }, [])
     
     // Memoize expensive computations to prevent memory buildup
     const optimizedFilterFunctions = useMemo(() => ({
       hasNoAssignments: (projectId: number, metadata: FilterMetadata) => 
         metadata?.project_filters?.[projectId]?.assignment_count === 0,
       hasNoFutureDeliverables: (projectId: number, metadata: FilterMetadata) =>
         !metadata?.project_filters?.[projectId]?.has_future_deliverables
     }), []) // Empty dependency array - functions are pure

   - hasNoAssignments(projectId, filterMetadata)
   - hasNoFutureDeliverables(projectId, filterMetadata) 
   - matchesStatusFilter(project, statusFilter, filterMetadata)
2. Functions should use O(1) lookup from filterMetadata

### **STEP 4: Performance Optimization and Cache Management**

#### **Step 4.1: Implement Smart Cache Strategy with Race Condition Prevention**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Implement comprehensive cache invalidation strategy with race condition prevention and defined SLAs.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ATOMIC CACHE OPERATIONS WITH LOCKING:**
   ```typescript
   // FIXED: Atomic cache operations with locking
   class CacheManager {
     private invalidationLocks = new Map<string, Promise<void>>()
     
     async invalidateWithLock(cacheKey: string, projectIds: number[]): Promise<void> {
       const lockKey = `invalidation_${cacheKey}`
       
       // Prevent concurrent invalidations of same data
       if (this.invalidationLocks.has(lockKey)) {
         await this.invalidationLocks.get(lockKey)
         return
       }
       
       const invalidationPromise = this.performInvalidation(cacheKey, projectIds)
       this.invalidationLocks.set(lockKey, invalidationPromise)
       
       try {
         await invalidationPromise
       } finally {
         this.invalidationLocks.delete(lockKey)
       }
     }
     
     private async performInvalidation(cacheKey: string, projectIds: number[]): Promise<void> {
       // Atomic cache invalidation
       await queryClient.cancelQueries([cacheKey])
       await queryClient.invalidateQueries([cacheKey, { projectIds }])
     }
   }
   ```

2. **SMART INVALIDATION STRATEGY:**
   ```typescript
   // Replace blanket invalidation with targeted approach
   const invalidateFilterCache = (projectIds: number[]) => {
     // Only invalidate specific projects, not entire cache
     queryClient.invalidateQueries(['projectFilterMetadata', { projectIds }])
   }
   
   // Prevent cache thrashing from rapid updates
   const debouncedInvalidation = useDebouncedCallback(
     (projectIds: number[]) => invalidateFilterCache(projectIds),
     1000 // 1 second debounce
   )
   ```

3. **CACHE INVALIDATION SLAs:**
   - **Eventual Consistency Window**: 30 seconds maximum
   - **Critical Operations**: Assignment/deliverable CRUD must invalidate cache within 5 seconds
   - **Batch Operations**: Bulk updates get 60-second consistency window
   - **Failure Recovery**: Cache misses must fallback to live queries with < 2x response time

4. Invalidate filter metadata cache when:
   - New assignment is created/updated/deleted
   - New deliverable is created/updated/deleted (especially date changes)
   - Project status changes

- Use targeted cache invalidation instead of blanket invalidation
- Implement atomic cache operations with locking mechanisms
- Use React Query's useMutation onSuccess callbacks with debouncing
- Include comprehensive error handling for failed invalidations
- Add performance monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios

CACHE STRATEGY:
- Use smart invalidation that only affects relevant projects

- Use background refetch to update cache without blocking UI
- Set appropriate stale time (30 seconds) with keepPreviousData
- Include circuit breaker for cache operations

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Cache invalidates when assignments are added/removed
- Cache invalidates when deliverable dates are modified
- UI updates immediately reflect changes
- No stale data displayed after mutations
- Cache hit ratio must exceed 80% after initial load
- Race condition testing with concurrent users
- Cache consistency validation across multiple browser tabs
```

*This plan follows lean programming best practices, avoids band-aid solutions, and ensures robust implementation with proper testing at each step.*

---

## Phase 2: Opportunities 1, 2, 3, and 4

Purpose: Extend the optimization with deeper backend performance work, person search optimization, smarter client/server caching, and optional precomputation to keep the Projects page fast as data grows.

Notes:
- Phase 2 builds on Phase 1; keep Phase 1 feature flags and fallbacks until Phase 2 is fully validated.
- All additions must follow existing naming standards, error-handling, and testing rigor.

### Opportunity 1: Database-Level Optimizations (Indexes + Query Plans)

Goal: Reduce query latency and ensure stable performance under larger datasets by adding targeted indexes and verifying ORM-generated SQL.

Scope:
- Add composite and conditional indexes on hot paths used by filter metadata.
- Verify and tune ORM annotations to avoid unnecessary subqueries.
- Document EXPLAIN plans before/after.

Implementation Steps:
1) Indexes (migration in backend):
   - Deliverables: index on (project_id, date) and a partial index for date IS NOT NULL.
   - Assignments: index on (project_id, is_active) and GIN index on weekly_hours if used in any JSON containment checks (future-proofing, optional).
   - Projects: index on status and is_active.

2) ORM tuning in filter metadata view:
   - Ensure annotation for assignment_count only counts is_active=True.
   - Ensure future_deliverable_count uses date__gt=today and date__isnull=False with the new indexes.
   - Avoid per-row subqueries where aggregation+grouping can produce the same result in one pass.

3) Query plan verification:
   - Capture EXPLAIN ANALYZE for the filter-metadata query on representative data (100‚Äì1,000 projects).
   - Add a short ‚ÄúPerformance.md‚Äù snippet in the projects app documenting observed plans and index usage.

Tests & Acceptance:
- Query count stable (< 5) regardless of project volume.
- p95 response time for 500 projects < 150ms on dev hardware.
- EXPLAIN plans show index scans (no full sequential scans on deliverables/assignments).

### Opportunity 2: Person Search Optimization (High Priority)

Goal: Eliminate N+1 API calls during person search by creating a single optimized endpoint that returns person availability, utilization, and skill matching in one request.

**Current Problem Analysis:**
- PersonSearch makes calculatePersonAvailability() for each person (lines 573-647 in ProjectsList.tsx)
- Each availability calculation triggers a separate API call to /api/people/{id}/utilization/
- Complex client-side skill matching calculation runs for every search result
- Results in 5+ API calls per person search, causing noticeable lag

Scope:
- Create /api/people/search-with-availability/ endpoint with comprehensive person data
- Include pre-calculated availability, utilization, and skill matching scores
- Replace client-side N+1 pattern with single optimized backend call
- Maintain existing search functionality and sorting logic

Implementation Steps:

**Step 2.1: Backend Person Search Endpoint**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Create optimized person search endpoint at /api/people/search-with-availability/ that eliminates N+1 queries from ProjectsList person search.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create backend/people/views.py method: PersonSearchWithAvailabilityView(APIView)
2. Accept query parameters:
   - search_term: string (name, email search)
   - required_skills: comma-separated skill keywords
   - current_week: ISO date (defaults to current Monday)
   - project_id: optional project context for conflict checking
   - limit: max results (default 5)

3. Single database query using ORM annotations to return:
   - Basic person data (id, name, email, role, department)
   - Pre-calculated availability: availableHours, utilizationPercent, totalHours
   - Skill matching score based on required_skills parameter
   - Current week utilization data

4. Response format:
   {
     "people": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "name": "John Doe", 
         "email": "john@company.com",
         "role": "Developer",
         "availableHours": 25,
         "utilizationPercent": 75,
         "totalHours": 40,
         "skillMatchScore": 85,
         "hasSkillMatch": true,
         "weeklyCapacity": 40
       }
     ],
     "total_count": 12
   }

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Use select_related('department', 'role') to prevent N+1 queries
- Compute utilization using same logic as existing /api/people/{id}/utilization/ endpoint
- Implement skill matching using database similarity functions (trigram, etc.)
- Include search across name, email, and role fields
- Apply proper permissions following existing patterns

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Single database query regardless of result count
- Response time < 100ms for searches returning 5 people
- Skill matching scores match client-side calculation logic
- Search results properly filtered and sorted
```

**Step 2.2: Frontend Person Search Integration**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Replace existing person search logic in ProjectsList.tsx to use the new optimized endpoint.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Update performPersonSearch function to use new API endpoint:
   - Replace individual calculatePersonAvailability calls with single API call
   - Remove client-side skill matching calculation
   - Maintain existing search result sorting and filtering logic

2. Add new API method to frontend/src/services/api.ts:
   searchWithAvailability(searchTerm: string, requiredSkills: string[], currentWeek?: string, limit?: number)

3. Create TypeScript interface for response:
   interface PersonSearchWithAvailabilityResponse {
     people: PersonWithAvailability[];
     total_count: number;
   }

4. Update existing PersonWithAvailability interface if needed
5. Maintain backward compatibility during transition

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Keep existing performPersonSearch function signature unchanged
- Replace internal implementation to use new optimized endpoint
- Add error handling and fallback to existing logic if new endpoint fails
- Include performance timing logs to measure improvement
- Preserve existing accessibility features (screen reader announcements)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- DO NOT change the component interface or search behavior from user perspective
- Keep fallback to existing search logic if new endpoint unavailable
- Maintain existing keyboard navigation and selection functionality
- Preserve search result limiting (5 results) and sorting logic

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Person search performance dramatically improved (5+ API calls ‚Üí 1 API call)
- Search results identical to existing implementation
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility preserved
- Error handling graceful with proper fallback
- No regressions in search functionality
```

**Step 2.3: Performance Validation and Cleanup**

**Prompt for AI Agent:**
```
Validate person search performance improvement and clean up legacy code.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add performance monitoring to compare old vs new search times:
   - Log API call count reduction
   - Measure total search response time improvement
   - Track memory usage during search operations

2. Validation tests:
   - Verify search results match between old and new implementations
   - Test edge cases (no results, special characters, long search terms)
   - Confirm skill matching scores are equivalent
   - Test with various dataset sizes

3. Clean up legacy code after validation:
   - Remove calculatePersonAvailability function from ProjectsList.tsx
   - Remove individual utilization API calls
   - Clean up unused PersonSkill mapping logic
   - Remove legacy performance monitoring code

PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
- Person search API calls reduced from 5+ to 1
- Search response time improved by 70%+ 
- Memory usage stable or reduced
- User experience noticeably more responsive

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Only remove legacy code after comprehensive testing
- Keep git history for easy rollback
- Document performance improvements achieved
- Maintain fallback mechanisms during transition period

TEST REQUIREMENTS:
- Performance improvement measurable and significant
- All search functionality preserved without regression
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Cleanup completed without breaking functionality
```

Tests & Acceptance:
- Person search triggers only 1 API call instead of N+1 pattern
- Search response time improved by 70%+ compared to Phase 1
- All existing search functionality preserved (sorting, keyboard nav, accessibility)
- Skill matching accuracy maintained or improved

### Opportunity 3: HTTP Caching (ETag/Last-Modified) + Client Cache Strategy

Goal: Avoid recomputing and re-downloading unchanged filter metadata; leverage conditional requests and React Query cache.

Scope:
- Backend: Add ETag/Last-Modified headers to /api/projects/filter-metadata/ based on a checksum or max(updated_at) across Projects, Assignments, Deliverables.
- Frontend: Use conditional requests; honor 304 Not Modified; set sane staleTime and retry policies.

Implementation Steps:
1) Backend conditional responses:
   - Compute last_modified = max(Project.updated_at, Assignment.updated_at, Deliverable.updated_at) across relevant rows.
   - Optionally compute a fast ETag (hash of ids + counts) for stronger validation.
   - If-None-Match/If-Modified-Since handling to return 304 quickly.

2) Headers and cache control:
   - Add Cache-Control: public, max-age=30 for short-term freshness.
   - Ensure Vary headers are correct if auth or tenant contexts exist.

3) Frontend integration:
   - React Query: set staleTime to 30s; use keepPreviousData.
   - On 304, serve cached data instantly; track served-from-cache in dev logs for visibility.

Tests & Acceptance:
- Repeated navigations within 30s do not trigger full payload downloads.
- Conditional GET returns 304 when data unchanged; observed in network panel.
- No functional regressions; cache invalidation from Phase 1 still works.

### Opportunity 4: Precomputed Project Stats (Optional, Feature-Flagged)

Goal: Eliminate per-request aggregation for very large datasets by maintaining a lightweight denormalized stats table.

Scope:
- New table project_stats with columns: project_id (PK/FK), active_assignment_count, has_future_deliverables, updated_at.
- Signals or explicit service layer updates on Assignment/Deliverable mutations.
- Endpoint uses project_stats for O(1) lookups instead of runtime aggregation.

Implementation Steps:
1) Schema & model:
   - backend/projects/models.py: class ProjectStats(models.Model) with fields above; unique FK to Project.
   - Migration to backfill stats for existing data.

2) Update pipeline:
   - Post-save/delete hooks (signals) on Assignment and Deliverable to recalc just the affected project.
   - Provide a management command projects_rebuild_stats for full rebuild.

3) Endpoint switch (behind feature flag):
   - Add settings.FEATURES['USE_PROJECT_STATS'] = False by default.
   - If enabled, filter-metadata endpoint reads directly from ProjectStats.

4) Observability:
   - Add lightweight logging to track rebuild time and frequency.
   - Include metrics counters for ‚Äústats reads‚Äù vs ‚Äúaggregations.‚Äù

Tests & Acceptance:
- Stats backfill completes successfully; counts match live aggregation.
- Per-request response time improves under large datasets (1k+ projects).
- Feature flag off ‚Üí behavior identical to Phase 1; on ‚Üí returns same results by contract.

Rollout & Safety:
- Keep Phase 1 aggregation as the source of truth until parity verified in tests and a shadow-compare mode.
- Provide a rollback path (toggle feature flag, disable signals).

---

Validation Summary for Phase 2:
- Measurable improvements in response time and reduced payload churn.
- Zero functional regressions; filters produce identical results to Phase 1.
- Clear observability around caching hits, stats usage, and query plans.
