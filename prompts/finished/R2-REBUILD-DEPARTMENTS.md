# R2-REBUILD-DEPARTMENTS: Department Frontend Implementation

## Purpose
Complete the Chunk 6 department system by implementing the missing frontend interfaces. The backend department system is fully implemented - this guide focuses purely on standards-compliant UI implementation to provide complete department management functionality.

## Context
Departments were part of Chunk 6 implementation, with backend models, API endpoints, and Person.department FK relationships already created. However, the frontend UI for managing departments was never implemented. This guide fills that gap.

## Pre-Implementation Verification

### Backend Readiness Checklist
- ‚úÖ **Department Model**: `backend/departments/models.py` exists with full schema
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Department CRUD endpoints available at `/api/departments/`
- ‚úÖ **Person Integration**: `Person.department` FK field active
- ‚úÖ **Settings Active**: `USE_DEPARTMENTS: True` in backend settings
- ‚úÖ **Database Migration**: Department tables created and populated

### Pre-Implementation Health Check (MANDATORY)
Run this sequence before starting ANY implementation:
```bash
# 1. Container Health Check
docker-compose ps
echo "‚úÖ All containers should show 'Up'"

# 2. Backend API Test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health/ | grep "healthy"
echo "‚úÖ Should return: healthy"

# 3. Frontend Load Test  
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep "<title>"
echo "‚úÖ Should return: <title>Workload Tracker</title>"

# 4. Department API Test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | grep -E "(count|results)"
echo "‚úÖ Should return department data or empty results"

# 5. Console Warning Check
echo "üñ•Ô∏è  Open browser dev tools - should be NO warnings"
```

‚ùå **STOP if any of these fail** - Fix infrastructure before proceeding

### Standards Compliance Requirements
This implementation MUST follow `R2-REBUILD-STANDARDS.md`:
- **Naming Consistency**: Backend `snake_case` ‚Üî Frontend `camelCase` transformation
- **Component Patterns**: Follow existing `PeopleList.tsx` and `PersonForm.tsx` structures
- **VSCode Dark Theme**: Use ONLY established color scheme (`#1e1e1e`, `#2d2d30`, `#3e3e42`, etc.)
- **API Integration**: Proper field mapping and error handling
- **State Management**: Follow auto-selection and data flow patterns

### Red Flag Indicators 
‚ùå **STOP IMMEDIATELY if you see:**
- Console errors or warnings in browser dev tools
- Import resolution failures (`Cannot resolve module` errors)
- HTTP 500 errors from backend API
- Empty/broken frontend pages (blank screens)
- Version mismatch warnings in npm
- Docker container restart loops
- TypeScript compilation errors

---

## Phase 1: Core Department CRUD Interface (2-3 hours)

### **Goal**: Create complete department management interface

### Step 1.1: Backend Serializer Verification (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
**File**: `backend/departments/serializers.py`

**BEFORE writing ANY frontend code, verify the Department serializer exists and is complete:**

```python
# backend/departments/serializers.py - MUST exist and be complete
class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Every frontend field must be explicitly mapped
    parentDepartment = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(
        source='parent_department', 
        queryset=Department.objects.all(), 
        required=False, 
        allow_null=True
    )
    managerName = serializers.CharField(source='manager.name', read_only=True)
    isActive = serializers.BooleanField(source='is_active')
    createdAt = serializers.DateTimeField(source='created_at', read_only=True)
    updatedAt = serializers.DateTimeField(source='updated_at', read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Department
        fields = [
            'id', 
            'name', 
            'parentDepartment',    # ‚úÖ MUST be in fields list
            'manager',
            'managerName',         # ‚úÖ MUST be in fields list
            'description',
            'isActive',           # ‚úÖ MUST be in fields list
            'createdAt',          # ‚úÖ MUST be in fields list
            'updatedAt',          # ‚úÖ MUST be in fields list
        ]
```

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. **Test the serializer BEFORE frontend work**: `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/`
2. **Check every field appears in response** - if missing, frontend will break
3. **Restart backend container** after any serializer changes
4. **Verify field names match TypeScript interface** exactly

### Step 1.2: API Integration Foundation
**File**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

**Requirements**:
- Add `departmentsApi` object with full CRUD methods
- Follow existing API patterns (`peopleApi`, `projectsApi`)
- Include proper TypeScript return types
- Handle snake_case ‚Üî camelCase transformation

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Follow existing pattern from peopleApi
export const departmentsApi = {
  list: () => fetchApi<PaginatedResponse<Department>>('/departments/'),
  get: (id: number) => fetchApi<Department>(`/departments/${id}/`),
  create: (data: Partial<Department>) => fetchApi<Department>('/departments/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  }),
  update: (id: number, data: Partial<Department>) => fetchApi<Department>(`/departments/${id}/`, {
    method: 'PATCH',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  }),
  delete: (id: number) => fetchApi<void>(`/departments/${id}/`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  })
};
```

### Step 1.3: TypeScript Interface Definition
**File**: `frontend/src/types/models.ts`

**Requirements**:
- Define `Department` interface with camelCase fields
- Include all backend fields with proper TypeScript types
- Add to existing exports

**CRITICAL**: After adding this interface, you MUST restart containers:
```bash
# After any TypeScript interface changes
docker-compose build frontend
docker-compose restart frontend
# Wait 30 seconds, then test: curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep "<title>"
```

**Interface Structure**:
```typescript
export interface Department {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  parentDepartment: number | null;    // snake_case ‚Üí camelCase
  manager: number | null;
  managerName?: string;               // Computed field from backend
  description: string;
  isActive: boolean;                  // snake_case ‚Üí camelCase
  createdAt: string;                  // snake_case ‚Üí camelCase
  updatedAt: string;                  // snake_case ‚Üí camelCase
}
```

### Step 1.4: Department List Page
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Departments/DepartmentsList.tsx`

**Requirements**:
- Follow `PeopleList.tsx` structure exactly
- Use same Card, Button, Input components
- Implement same search/filter patterns
- Use VSCode dark theme colors
- Include hierarchy visualization (parent/child relationships)

**State Management Pattern** (MANDATORY from R2-REBUILD-STANDARDS.md):
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Auto-selection after sorting
const sortedDepartments = useMemo(() => {
  return departments.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
}, [departments]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Auto-select first item from sorted list
  if (sortedDepartments.length > 0 && !selectedDepartment) {
    setSelectedDepartment(sortedDepartments[0]);
    setSelectedIndex(0);
  }
}, [sortedDepartments, selectedDepartment]);

// ‚ùå WRONG - Never select before sorting
```

**Component Structure**:
```typescript
// Follow PeopleList.tsx pattern EXACTLY:
// 1. State management (departments, loading, error, selectedDepartment)
// 2. useEffect for data loading with auto-selection
// 3. CRUD handlers (create, update, delete)
// 4. Search and filter functionality
// 5. Card-based layout with actions
// 6. Modal for create/edit forms
```

**Key Features**:
- Department cards showing name, manager, description
- Parent department hierarchy display
- Team member count per department
- Manager assignment status
- Search by department name
- Filter by active/inactive status

### Step 1.5: Department Form Modal
**File**: `frontend/src/components/departments/DepartmentForm.tsx`

**Requirements**:
- Follow `PersonForm.tsx` structure and patterns
- Use same form components and validation
- Handle parent department selection (dropdown)
- Manager assignment (Person dropdown)
- Proper error handling and loading states

**Form Fields**:
```typescript
interface DepartmentFormData {
  name: string;                    // Required
  parentDepartment: number | null; // Optional dropdown
  manager: number | null;          // Optional Person selector
  description: string;             // Optional textarea
  isActive: boolean;              // Checkbox, default true
}
```

**CRITICAL API Debugging Protocol** (from R2-REBUILD-STANDARDS.md):
```typescript
// Log every API interaction during development
const handleSaveDepartment = async (formData: DepartmentFormData) => {
  const updateData = {
    name: formData.name,
    parentDepartment: formData.parentDepartment,
    manager: formData.manager,
    description: formData.description,
    isActive: formData.isActive
  };
  
  console.log('üü° Sending to backend:', updateData);
  
  try {
    const response = await departmentsApi.create(updateData);
    console.log('üü¢ Backend returned:', response);
    
    // After refresh - verify field mapping worked
    const refreshedData = await departmentsApi.list();
    console.log('üîç Refreshed data:', refreshedData.results?.map(dept => ({
      id: dept.id,
      name: dept.name,
      parentDepartment: dept.parentDepartment,  // Verify camelCase
      isActive: dept.isActive                   // Verify camelCase
    })));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('üî¥ API Error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 1.6: Navigation Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`

**Requirements**:
- Add "Departments" menu item
- Use department icon (üè¢ or similar)
- Place in logical navigation order (after People, before Projects)
- Follow existing navigation patterns

**Router Setup**:

// Add to dashboard:
// 1. Department selector in header (next to time period selector)
// 2. Department state management
// 3. Pass department filter to dashboard API
// 4. Update all dashboard sections to respect department filter
```

### Step 3.2: Department-Specific Metrics
**Enhancement to Dashboard API** (backend):
- Update dashboard API to accept department parameter
- Filter all metrics by department when provided
- Maintain existing behavior when no department specified

### Step 3.3: Department Comparison View

---

## Implementation Standards Checklist

### Serializer Mismatch Prevention Protocol (CRITICAL)
**Based on project history of frontend-backend-serializer mismatches**

#### Pre-Implementation Serializer Verification
**MANDATORY before any frontend code:**
```bash
# 1. Test current serializer state
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | head -100

# 2. Check if all required fields appear in response
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | grep -E "(parentDepartment|managerName|isActive|createdAt)"

# 3. If fields are missing, serializer needs work FIRST
```

#### Common Serializer Mismatch Patterns (AVOID THESE)
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Field defined but not in Meta.fields
class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    parentDepartment = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(source='parent_department')
    
    class Meta:
        fields = ['id', 'name']  # Missing 'parentDepartment' ‚Üê BREAKS FRONTEND

# ‚ùå WRONG - Field in Meta.fields but not defined
class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'parentDepartment']  # Field not defined ‚Üê BREAKS FRONTEND

# ‚ùå WRONG - Wrong source mapping
class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    parentDepartment = serializers.IntegerField(source='parent')  # Wrong source ‚Üê BREAKS FRONTEND
```

#### Required Serializer Completeness Check
**Every frontend field MUST have matching serializer field:**

| Frontend Field | Backend Field | Serializer Definition Required |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `id` | `id` | Auto-included |
| `name` | `name` | Auto-included |
| `parentDepartment` | `parent_department` | ‚úÖ `parentDepartment = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(source='parent_department')` |
| `manager` | `manager` | Auto-included |
| `managerName` | `manager.name` | ‚úÖ `managerName = serializers.CharField(source='manager.name', read_only=True)` |
| `description` | `description` | Auto-included |
| `isActive` | `is_active` | ‚úÖ `isActive = serializers.BooleanField(source='is_active')` |
| `createdAt` | `created_at` | ‚úÖ `createdAt = serializers.DateTimeField(source='created_at', read_only=True)` |
| `updatedAt` | `updated_at` | ‚úÖ `updatedAt = serializers.DateTimeField(source='updated_at', read_only=True)` |

### 5-Step Field Mapping Verification (MANDATORY from R2-REBUILD-STANDARDS.md)
**EVERY field must pass this 5-step verification:**

- [ ] **Step 1**: Model field exists in backend (`parent_department` in database)
- [ ] **Step 2**: Serializer field defined (`parentDepartment = serializers.IntegerField(source='parent_department')`)
- [ ] **Step 3**: Field included in Meta.fields list (`'parentDepartment'`)
- [ ] **Step 4**: Container restarted after serializer changes (`docker-compose restart backend`)
- [ ] **Step 5**: Full cycle tested: frontend save ‚Üí backend store ‚Üí frontend retrieve ‚Üí display

#### Serializer Testing Commands (Run After Any Backend Changes)
```bash
# Test department creation with all fields
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Department",
    "parentDepartment": null,
    "manager": null,
    "description": "Test Description",
    "isActive": true
  }'

# Verify response contains all expected camelCase fields
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | grep -o '"[^"]*":' | sort | uniq
# Should show: "createdAt": "description": "id": "isActive": "manager": "managerName": "name": "parentDepartment": "updatedAt":
```

### Field Mapping Compliance
- [ ] All backend `snake_case` fields mapped to frontend `camelCase`
- [ ] Department `parentDepartment` ‚Üî `parent_department` (5-step verified)
- [ ] Department `isActive` ‚Üî `is_active` (5-step verified)
- [ ] Department `createdAt` ‚Üî `created_at` (5-step verified)  
- [ ] Department `updatedAt` ‚Üî `updated_at` (5-step verified)
- [ ] Department `managerName` ‚Üî computed field (5-step verified)

### Component Pattern Compliance
- [ ] DepartmentsList follows PeopleList.tsx structure
- [ ] DepartmentForm follows PersonForm.tsx structure
- [ ] Same state management patterns (loading, error, selected item)
- [ ] Same CRUD operation patterns
- [ ] Same search and filter implementation

### VSCode Dark Theme Compliance
- [ ] Background: `#1e1e1e` (app background)
- [ ] Cards: `bg-[#2d2d30] border-[#3e3e42]`
- [ ] Primary text: `text-[#cccccc]`
- [ ] Secondary text: `text-[#969696]`
- [ ] Primary button: `bg-[#007acc]`
- [ ] NO slate-* Tailwind classes used

### Department-Specific Utilization Colors (CRITICAL from CLAUDE.md)
**When showing department utilization metrics, use EXACTLY these colors:**
- [ ] **Available**: `text-emerald-400` (Under 70% utilization)
- [ ] **Optimal**: `text-blue-400` (70-85% utilization)
- [ ] **High**: `text-amber-400` (85-100% utilization)
- [ ] **Overallocated**: `text-red-400` (Over 100% utilization)

**Example Implementation**:
```typescript
const getDepartmentUtilizationStyle = (percent: number) => {
  if (percent < 70) return 'text-emerald-400'      // Available
  if (percent <= 85) return 'text-blue-400'       // Optimal
  if (percent <= 100) return 'text-amber-400'     // High
  return 'text-red-400'                           // Overallocated
}
```

### API Integration Compliance
- [ ] Proper error handling on all API calls
- [ ] Loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Success notifications for CRUD operations
- [ ] Proper TypeScript typing for all API responses
- [ ] Container restart after any serializer changes

### State Management Compliance
- [ ] Auto-selection after sorting/filtering
- [ ] Proper cleanup of state on unmount
- [ ] Consistent data flow patterns
- [ ] No direct state mutations

---

## Testing Protocol

### Mandatory Test Sequence (After EVERY Change)
**Run this sequence after ANY code change - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

```bash
# 1. Container Health Check
docker-compose ps
echo "‚úÖ All containers should show 'Up'"

# 2. Backend API Test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/health/ | grep "healthy"
echo "‚úÖ Should return: healthy"

# 3. Frontend Load Test  
curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | grep "<title>"
echo "‚úÖ Should return: <title>Workload Tracker</title>"

# 4. Department CRUD Test
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | grep -E "(count|results)"
echo "‚úÖ Should return department data"

# 5. Console Warning Check
echo "üñ•Ô∏è  Open browser dev tools - should be NO warnings"
```

### After Config Changes (TypeScript interfaces, vite.config.ts, package.json)
```bash
# Full rebuild sequence - MANDATORY
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
# Wait 30 seconds
# Run mandatory test sequence above
```

‚ùå **NEVER continue development if any test fails**

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Department CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create new department successfully
- [ ] Edit department name and description
- [ ] Assign manager to department
- [ ] Set parent department relationships
- [ ] Delete department (with confirmation)
- [ ] Search departments by name
- [ ] Filter by active/inactive status

#### People-Department Integration
- [ ] Assign person to department during creation
- [ ] Change person's department during editing
- [ ] Display department name in people list
- [ ] Filter people by department
- [ ] Bulk department assignment (if implemented)

#### Dashboard Department Features
- [ ] Filter dashboard by department
- [ ] Department-specific utilization metrics
- [ ] Department selector functionality
- [ ] "All Departments" option working

#### Assignment Department Features
- [ ] Department shown in person selection
- [ ] Same-department preference working
- [ ] Cross-department assignment warnings (if implemented)

### Error Handling Verification
- [ ] API errors display user-friendly messages
- [ ] Network failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] Loading states prevent duplicate operations
- [ ] Empty states display appropriate messages

### Serializer Mismatch Troubleshooting Guide
**When frontend shows undefined/missing fields:**

#### Symptoms of Serializer Mismatches:
- ‚ùå Frontend shows `undefined` for expected fields
- ‚ùå TypeScript errors: `Property 'parentDepartment' does not exist`
- ‚ùå Form submissions fail silently
- ‚ùå Data displays as `[object Object]` or blank

#### Diagnostic Commands (Run in Order):
```bash
# 1. Check actual API response structure
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | jq '.' | head -20

# 2. Compare with expected TypeScript interface
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | jq '.results[0]' 

# 3. Check serializer field names match exactly
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | jq '.results[0] | keys'
# Should return: ["createdAt", "description", "id", "isActive", "manager", "managerName", "name", "parentDepartment", "updatedAt"]

# 4. Test single department detail endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/1/ | jq '.'

# 5. Check backend logs for serialization errors
docker-compose logs backend --tail=50 | grep -i error
```

#### Fix Patterns for Common Mismatches:
```python
# Problem: Frontend expects 'parentDepartment' but gets 'parent_department'
# Solution: Add explicit field mapping in serializer

# ‚úÖ CORRECT serializer pattern
class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    parentDepartment = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(
        source='parent_department', 
        queryset=Department.objects.all(), 
        required=False, 
        allow_null=True
    )
    
    class Meta:
        model = Department
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'parentDepartment']  # Must include mapped field

# Problem: managerName shows as null instead of actual name
# Solution: Check manager relationship and serializer source

# ‚úÖ CORRECT related field pattern  
managerName = serializers.CharField(source='manager.name', read_only=True)
```

#### Emergency Serializer Reset Protocol:
**If serializer is completely broken:**
1. **Backup current serializer**: `cp backend/departments/serializers.py backend/departments/serializers.py.backup`
2. **Create minimal working serializer** with just basic fields
3. **Test basic functionality**: `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/`
4. **Add fields one by one**, testing after each addition
5. **Restart backend container** after each serializer change

### API Integration Error Investigation Sequence
**When API calls fail, debug in this EXACT order:**
1. **Frontend logs**: `console.log('Sending to backend:', data)` - verify data being sent
2. **API response check**: `console.log('Backend returned:', response)` - check field names
3. **Backend logs**: `docker-compose logs backend --tail=20` - verify data received
4. **Serializer field check**: `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/departments/ | jq '.results[0] | keys'`
5. **Database check**: Django admin or database query - verify data stored correctly  
6. **Container restart**: `docker-compose restart backend frontend` - required after serializer changes

### Container Restart Requirements
**ALWAYS restart containers after these changes:**
- Adding/modifying TypeScript interfaces (`frontend/src/types/models.ts`)
- Changing vite.config.ts or tsconfig.json
- Backend serializer field changes
- Package.json dependency changes
- Environment variable changes

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Department list loads quickly (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Dashboard department filtering is responsive
- [ ] Person-department assignment is immediate
- [ ] No unnecessary API calls during navigation

---

## Rollback Plan

If implementation issues arise:

1. **Phase Rollback**: Each phase is independent - can disable incomplete phases
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to hide incomplete department features
3. **API Compatibility**: All changes maintain backward compatibility
4. **Database Safety**: No database schema changes - only UI additions

---

## Post-Implementation Updates

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` project status: "Chunk 6 Complete (Departments + Skills)"
- [ ] Update navigation in project README
- [ ] Add department management to user guide

### Settings Updates

### Quick Serializer Verification Checklist (Print This Out)
**Before ANY frontend development:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ 1. Backend serializer exists and is complete
ls -la backend/departments/serializers.py

# ‚úÖ 2. API responds with expected fields
