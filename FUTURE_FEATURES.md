# Future Features & Enhancements

This document tracks planned features and improvements for the Workload Tracker application.

## üö® High Priority - Performance & Scalability

### 1. Bulk API Pagination Safeguards

**Problem**: Current bulk APIs (`?all=true`) have no size limits, which could cause memory/performance issues as datasets grow.

**Current Status**: 
- Dataset size: ~500 total records across all APIs
- Risk level: Low (safe for current scale)
- No size limits implemented

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Phase 1: Add Size Limits
1. **Backend Changes**:
   ```python
   # Add to each bulk endpoint in views.py
   if request.query_params.get('all') == 'true':
       count = queryset.count()
       if count > BULK_API_LIMIT:  # e.g., 1000
           return Response({
               'error': 'Dataset too large for bulk operation',
               'count': count,
               'max_bulk_size': BULK_API_LIMIT,
               'suggestion': 'Use pagination instead'
           }, status=status.HTTP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE)
   ```

2. **Configuration**:
   ```python
   # Add to settings.py
   BULK_API_LIMITS = {
       'people': 1000,
       'projects': 1000, 
       'assignments': 2000,  # Higher limit - grows exponentially
       'deliverables': 1500,
       'departments': 100,
   }
   ```

#### Phase 2: Frontend Fallback Handling
3. **Update Frontend APIs**:
   ```typescript
   // Update each listAll() method in api.ts
   listAll: async (): Promise<Project[]> => {
     try {
       return await fetchApi<Project[]>('/projects/?all=true');
     } catch (error) {
       if (error.status === 413) {
         // Fallback to pagination
         console.warn('Dataset too large, falling back to pagination');
         return await this.loadAllWithPagination();
       }
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Add Pagination Fallback**:
   ```typescript
   private async loadAllWithPagination(): Promise<Project[]> {
     const allItems: Project[] = [];
     let page = 1;
     let hasMore = true;

     while (hasMore) {
       const response = await this.list({ page, page_size: 500 });
       allItems.push(...(response.results || []));
       hasMore = !!response.next;
       page++;
     }
     return allItems;
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
5. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Response time tracking for bulk endpoints
   - Memory usage alerts
   - Dataset growth monitoring
   - Automated alerts when approaching limits

6. **Database Optimization**:
   - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement query optimization for large datasets
   - Consider database-level pagination improvements

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Trigger Point**: When any API dataset exceeds 1,000 records

## üìã Medium Priority - User Experience

### 2. Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Description**: Add advanced filtering options to all list views (date ranges, multiple selections, saved filters)
- **Components**: People, Projects, Assignments, Deliverables lists
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-5 days

### 3. Bulk Operations
- **Description**: Add bulk edit, delete, and status update capabilities
- **Features**: Select multiple items, batch operations, progress indicators

### 4. Data Export/Import Enhancements
- **Description**: Expand current Excel import/export with more formats and options
- **Features**: CSV, PDF reports, scheduled exports, import validation
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-4 days

### 5. Virtualized Lists Across App (People/Projects)
- **Description**: Use lightweight list virtualization (render only visible rows + small buffer) for large lists while keeping paginated fetching for network efficiency.
- **Current**: PeopleList now has a clean, isolated virtualized table component; Projects uses infinite pagination with ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù.
- **Plan**:
  - Extract Projects left-panel rows into a `ProjectsListTable` component.
  - Enable virtualization when `items.length > 200`; otherwise map normally.
  - Keep existing infinite query and ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù for network payload control.
- **Benefits**:
  - Smooth scrolling and lower memory/DOM size even after many pages are loaded.
  - Clear separation of concerns: page orchestration vs. table rendering.
  - Easier maintenance and reuse of row markup.
- **Trade‚Äëoffs**:
  - Virtualization complements but does not replace pagination.
  - Requires a reasonable row height estimate (tuneable; use 44px baseline).
- **Acceptance**:
  - Scrolling remains smooth with 1,000+ items loaded.
  - No visual/interaction regressions vs. current rows.
  - TS build passes; container build green.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 0.5‚Äì1 day (Projects parity)

  - Contextual help: deep-link anchors from UI ‚Äú?‚Äù icons to relevant sections
  - Copy-to-clipboard for example queries and shortcuts cheat-sheet
  - Link to API schema once available (Phase 10 OpenAPI)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Router route exists; Coming Soon page implemented (Phase 1.1)
  - Choose content delivery: MDX static pages in frontend or curated markdown compiled at build
  - Optional: surface API schema links after Phase 10.1 (`/schema/`, Swagger UI)
- **Milestones**:
  - M0 (done): `/help` route renders Coming Soon
  - M1: Static Help landing page with sections + anchor links
  - M2: Client-side search + table of contents
  - M3: Contextual links from major screens (e.g., People filters ‚Üí /help#filters)

### 10. Caching Layer Improvements
- **Description**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Benefits**: Improved response times, reduced database load
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### 10.1 Dockerized Redis Container (Staging/Prod Simulation)
- Intent: simulate deployment with a standalone Redis service while keeping dev on LocMem by default.
- Compose changes (docker-compose.yml):
  - Add `redis` service (image `redis:7-alpine`), `ports: ["6379:6379"]`, healthcheck (`redis-cli ping`).
  - Optional auth: `command: ["redis-server","--requirepass","${REDIS_PASSWORD}"]` and add `REDIS_PASSWORD` to `.env`.
  - Backend: add `depends_on: redis` and set `REDIS_URL` to `redis://${HOST_IP}:6379/1` (or in-network `redis://redis:6379/1`).
- Backend dependency: add `redis>=4.5` to `backend/requirements.txt` and rebuild backend.
- Settings: already support `REDIS_URL` env; LocMem fallback remains.
- Validation:
  - Bring up: `docker-compose up -d --build redis backend` and verify redis healthy.
  - Shell check: `from django.core.cache import cache; cache.set('k','v',60); cache.get('k')` via `manage.py shell`.
  - Endpoint timing: call `/api/people/capacity_heatmap/` and `/api/people/workload_forecast/` twice; expect HIT on second call.
- Security/ops: restrict Redis exposure (bridge network), set memory limits, optional eviction policy (`allkeys-lru`).

### 11. Automated Testing Suite
- **Description**: Expand test coverage with integration and end-to-end tests
- **Tools**: Playwright for E2E, expanded Django test suite
- **Estimated Timeline**: 4-5 days

### 12. Mobile Responsiveness Enhancements
- **Description**: Improve mobile experience, especially for assignment grid
- **Features**: Touch-friendly interactions, mobile-optimized layouts
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days
