# Future Features & Enhancements

This document tracks planned features and improvements for the Workload Tracker application.

### Sunday-only Week Keys Transition Completion

Goal: Fully standardize on Sunday-based week keys across backend, frontend, data, and docs; remove all Monday-based logic and fallbacks.

Implementation Steps:
1. Frontend alignment
   - Update `frontend/src/pages/Assignments/grid/utils.ts` to consume Sunday week keys and generate headers accordingly.
   - Remove any Monday-based assumptions in components, hooks, and tests; adjust fixtures to Sunday keys.
2. Backend alignment
   - Enforce Sunday-only keys in `weekly_hours` with a validator; add warnings during a short deprecation window.
   - Replace any Monday-based help text/docs in serializers (e.g., people) with Sunday wording.
3. Data migration
   - Implement a management command to re-key `weekly_hours` JSON from non-Sunday dates to the Sunday of the same week (idempotent; dry-run + report modes).
   - Run in staging; verify parity metrics; then run in production during a low-traffic window (with backups).
4. Transition removal
   - Disable the ‚Äúread-both (¬±3 days)‚Äù transition layer and remove fallback code paths.
   - Delete transitional tests; add Sunday-only tests for utilization and grid rendering.
5. Documentation and help
   - Update in-app help and README/docs to state Sunday-as-canonical.
   - Add a troubleshooting note for legacy exports/imports referencing Monday.
6. Acceptance criteria
   - No remaining references to Monday-based week starts in code/docs.
   - All `weekly_hours` keys validate as Sundays.
   - Frontend grid renders correct headers and values using Sunday keys.
   - Parity report shows expected utilization totals pre/post migration.
7. Rollback plan
   - Feature flag to re-enable transition read mode if regressions are detected.
   - Re-run migration in reverse (if necessary) using snapshot/backup restore process.

## üö® High Priority - Performance & Scalability

### 1. Bulk API Pagination Safeguards

**Problem**: Current bulk APIs (`?all=true`) have no size limits, which could cause memory/performance issues as datasets grow.

**Current Status**: 
- Dataset size: ~500 total records across all APIs
- Risk level: Low (safe for current scale)
- No size limits implemented

**Implementation Steps**:

#### Phase 1: Add Size Limits
1. **Backend Changes**:
   ```python
   # Add to each bulk endpoint in views.py
   if request.query_params.get('all') == 'true':
       count = queryset.count()
       if count > BULK_API_LIMIT:  # e.g., 1000
           return Response({
               'error': 'Dataset too large for bulk operation',
               'count': count,
               'max_bulk_size': BULK_API_LIMIT,
               'suggestion': 'Use pagination instead'
           }, status=status.HTTP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE)
   ```

2. **Configuration**:
   ```python
   # Add to settings.py
   BULK_API_LIMITS = {
       'people': 1000,
       'projects': 1000, 
       'assignments': 2000,  # Higher limit - grows exponentially
       'deliverables': 1500,
       'departments': 100,
   }
   ```

#### Phase 2: Frontend Fallback Handling
3. **Update Frontend APIs**:
   ```typescript
   // Update each listAll() method in api.ts
   listAll: async (): Promise<Project[]> => {
     try {
       return await fetchApi<Project[]>('/projects/?all=true');
     } catch (error) {
       if (error.status === 413) {
         // Fallback to pagination
         console.warn('Dataset too large, falling back to pagination');
         return await this.loadAllWithPagination();
       }
       throw error;
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Add Pagination Fallback**:
   ```typescript
   private async loadAllWithPagination(): Promise<Project[]> {
     const allItems: Project[] = [];
     let page = 1;
     let hasMore = true;

     while (hasMore) {
       const response = await this.list({ page, page_size: 500 });
       allItems.push(...(response.results || []));
       hasMore = !!response.next;
       page++;
     }
     return allItems;
   }
   ```

#### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
5. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Response time tracking for bulk endpoints
   - Memory usage alerts
   - Dataset growth monitoring
  - Automated alerts when approaching limits

6. **Database Optimization**:
  - Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Implement query optimization for large datasets
  - Consider database-level pagination improvements

## üßπ Cleanup ‚Äî Remove Slack Notifications (dead code)

Context
- The codebase contains an optional Slack webhook helper (`backend/core/notifications.py`) referenced by a few management commands, but Slack is not part of the target stack and is not planned for adoption.

Goal
- Remove Slack notification code and references to reduce maintenance surface and avoid confusion.

Scope & Steps
1. Delete helper and imports
   - Remove `backend/core/notifications.py` and any imports of `notify_slack` in:
     - `backend/core/management/commands/cleanup_backups.py`
     - `backend/core/management/commands/sync_backups.py`
     - `backend/core/management/commands/restore_latest_safety.py`
   - Replace with no-op comments or standard logging where appropriate.
2. Environment docs
   - Remove `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` from `.env.example` and any docs.
3. Tests
   - Remove Slack webhook validation tests (if present) and adjust any command tests that assumed Slack calls.
4. Security plan alignment
   - Remove or mark Phase 15 (Slack webhook handling) as ‚Äúnot applicable‚Äù.

Acceptance Criteria
- No references to Slack or `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` remain in code or docs.
- Test suite passes without Slack-related tests.
- Commands previously importing Slack still run without behavioral changes (use logging when needed).

## üë§ Self‚ÄëService Edits (Object‚ÄëLevel Writes for Regular Users)

Context
- Today, regular users are deny‚Äëby‚Äëdefault for writes; Admins/Managers perform edits. We added object‚Äëlevel checks mainly to prevent cross‚Äëobject writes.

Goal
- Allow regular (non‚Äëmanager) users to edit only their own linked Person record and their own Assignments while preserving RBAC for everything else.

Scope & Steps
1. Permissions logic
   - Update `backend/accounts/permissions.py:RoleBasedAccessPermission.has_object_permission` to return True for:
     - `people.person` when `obj.id == request.user.profile.person_id`.
     - `assignments.assignment` when `obj.person_id == request.user.profile.person_id`.
   - Keep Admins/Managers allowed for all relevant writes; other models remain manager/admin‚Äëonly.
2. Tests
   - Add tests asserting regular users can PATCH their own Person and their own Assignments; still 403 for others.
   - Keep existing deny/403 tests for cross‚Äëobject edits.
3. API docs / UI
   - Document allowed self‚Äëedits (which fields are user‚Äëeditable) and leave sensitive fields admin‚Äëonly.
   - UI: enable inline editing for the user‚Äôs own profile fields and assignment notes/hours as applicable.
4. Audit & rate limiting
   - Ensure changes still flow through existing throttles; add AdminAuditLog entries where appropriate.

Acceptance Criteria
- Regular users can successfully edit their own Person and their own Assignments; 403 on others.
- Admin/Manager behavior unchanged.
- Tests cover permit/deny matrix; docs updated.

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Trigger Point**: When any API dataset exceeds 1,000 records

## üìã Medium Priority - User Experience

### 2. Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Description**: Add advanced filtering options to all list views (date ranges, multiple selections, saved filters)
- **Components**: People, Projects, Assignments, Deliverables lists
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-5 days

### 3. Bulk Operations
- **Description**: Add bulk edit, delete, and status update capabilities
- **Features**: Select multiple items, batch operations, progress indicators

### 4. Data Export/Import Enhancements
- **Description**: Expand current Excel import/export with more formats and options
- **Features**: CSV, PDF reports, scheduled exports, import validation
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-4 days

### 5. Virtualized Lists Across App (People/Projects)
- **Description**: Use lightweight list virtualization (render only visible rows + small buffer) for large lists while keeping paginated fetching for network efficiency.
- **Current**: PeopleList now has a clean, isolated virtualized table component; Projects uses infinite pagination with ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù.
- **Plan**:
  - Extract Projects left-panel rows into a `ProjectsListTable` component.
  - Enable virtualization when `items.length > 200`; otherwise map normally.
  - Keep existing infinite query and ‚ÄúLoad more‚Äù for network payload control.
- **Benefits**:
  - Smooth scrolling and lower memory/DOM size even after many pages are loaded.
  - Clear separation of concerns: page orchestration vs. table rendering.
  - Easier maintenance and reuse of row markup.
- **Trade‚Äëoffs**:
  - Virtualization complements but does not replace pagination.
  - Requires a reasonable row height estimate (tuneable; use 44px baseline).
- **Acceptance**:
  - Scrolling remains smooth with 1,000+ items loaded.
  - No visual/interaction regressions vs. current rows.
  - TS build passes; container build green.
- **Estimated Timeline**: 0.5‚Äì1 day (Projects parity)

### 5. Real-time Notifications
- **Description**: Add real-time notifications for assignment changes, conflicts, deadlines

  - FAQ & Troubleshooting: common errors and friendly resolutions
- **Related Future UX**:
  - Searchable docs with typeahead (client-side index; highlight matches)
  - Contextual help: deep-link anchors from UI ‚Äú?‚Äù icons to relevant sections
  - Copy-to-clipboard for example queries and shortcuts cheat-sheet
  - Link to API schema once available (Phase 10 OpenAPI)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Router route exists; Coming Soon page implemented (Phase 1.1)
  - Choose content delivery: MDX static pages in frontend or curated markdown compiled at build
  - Optional: surface API schema links after Phase 10.1 (`/schema/`, Swagger UI)
- **Milestones**:
  - M0 (done): `/help` route renders Coming Soon
  - M1: Static Help landing page with sections + anchor links
  - M2: Client-side search + table of contents
  - M3: Contextual links from major screens (e.g., People filters ‚Üí /help#filters)
  - M4: Tips/Shortcuts overlay and accessibility notes
  - M5: Feedback link (mailto or form) and basic analytics on help usage
 - **Estimated Timeline**: 2‚Äì4 days for M1‚ÄìM2; additional 2‚Äì3 days for M3‚ÄìM5

## üîß Low Priority - Technical Improvements

### 9. API Rate Limiting Enhancements
- **Description**: Implement more sophisticated rate limiting based on user roles and endpoint types
- **Current**: Basic throttling on hot endpoints only
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 days

### 10. Caching Layer Improvements
- **Description**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Benefits**: Improved response times, reduced database load
- **Estimated Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### 10.1 Dockerized Redis Container (Staging/Prod Simulation)
- Intent: simulate deployment with a standalone Redis service while keeping dev on LocMem by default.
- Compose changes (docker-compose.yml):
  - Add `redis` service (image `redis:7-alpine`), `ports: ["6379:6379"]`, healthcheck (`redis-cli ping`).
  - Optional auth: `command: ["redis-server","--requirepass","${REDIS_PASSWORD}"]` and add `REDIS_PASSWORD` to `.env`.
  - Backend: add `depends_on: redis` and set `REDIS_URL` to `redis://${HOST_IP}:6379/1` (or in-network `redis://redis:6379/1`).
- Backend dependency: add `redis>=4.5` to `backend/requirements.txt` and rebuild backend.
- Settings: already support `REDIS_URL` env; LocMem fallback remains.
- Validation:
  - Bring up: `docker-compose up -d --build redis backend` and verify redis healthy.

---

### Global Search (Header)

- Description: Add a fast, global search in the top‚Äëright header to find people, projects, departments, and assignments from anywhere.
- UX
  - Input placeholder: ‚ÄúSearch people, projects‚Ä¶‚Äù with a compact ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù button.
  - Keyboard: Ctrl/Cmd+K to focus/expand, Arrow keys to navigate results, Enter to open.
  - Result groups: People, Projects, Departments, Assignments (with small badges and subtle separators).
  - No‚Äëresults state with suggestions and recent searches.
- Scope (MVP)
  - Client‚Äëside typeahead that calls a single backend endpoint (e.g., `/search?q=`) which federates across core entities and returns a ranked, trimmed result set.
  - Debounced requests (‚âà200 ms) with request cancellation; limit 8‚Äì10 results per group.
  - Highlight matching substrings in result labels; include small context (e.g., project client, department name).
- API Sketch
  - GET `/search?q=string&limit=8`
  - Response
    ```json
    {
      "people": [{"id":1,"name":"Alex Mehner","department":"Electrical"}],
      "projects": [{"id":42,"name":"Transit Hub","client":"Metro"}],
      "departments": [{"id":7,"name":"Mechanical"}],
      "assignments": [{"id":999,"person":"Brett Grossman","project":"Harbor"}]
    }
    ```
- Implementation Notes
  - Frontend: isolated `GlobalSearch` component; tokenized styles (light/dark friendly), accessible listbox pattern.
  - Backend: aggregator view that queries capped subsets with simple ranking (ILIKE/tsvector/Trigram depending on DB extensions available).
  - Performance: enforce tight caps per group; add total timeout budget (e.g., 150 ms backend target) and return partial groups when hitting limits.
  - Telemetry: record anonymized query length bins and group clicks to improve defaults; never store raw queries server‚Äëside.
- Accessibility
  - ARIA attributes for combobox/listbox; screen‚Äëreader friendly labels; focus ring uses `--focus` token.
  - Provide Escape to close; restore focus to the trigger.
- Estimated Timeline: 1‚Äì2 days (MVP) + 1 day for improved ranking/highlights.
  - Shell check: `from django.core.cache import cache; cache.set('k','v',60); cache.get('k')` via `manage.py shell`.
  - Endpoint timing: call `/api/people/capacity_heatmap/` and `/api/people/workload_forecast/` twice; expect HIT on second call.
- Security/ops: restrict Redis exposure (bridge network), set memory limits, optional eviction policy (`allkeys-lru`).

### 11. Automated Testing Suite
- **Description**: Expand test coverage with integration and end-to-end tests
- **Tools**: Playwright for E2E, expanded Django test suite
- **Estimated Timeline**: 4-5 days

### 12. Mobile Responsiveness Enhancements
- **Description**: Improve mobile experience, especially for assignment grid
- **Features**: Touch-friendly interactions, mobile-optimized layouts
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days

## üéØ Backlog Additions (from R2-REBUILD request)

These are intentionally deferred and tracked here for future implementation.

### Advanced Skills/Departments
- Skill gap analysis across teams and projects
- Department hierarchy visualization and roll-up metrics
- Bulk operations for departments and skills maintenance

Sources: `prompts/R2-REBUILD-DEPARTMENTS.md`, `prompts/R2-REBUILD-MASTER-GUIDE.md` (Chunk 6)

### Contracts/Compliance
- Contract tracking with key dates and budget checks
- Compliance checks aligned to client requirements

Source: `prompts/R2-REBUILD-CONTRACTS.md`

### Automation/Notifications
- Email notifications for assignment additions/changes and upcoming deadlines
- Automated suggestions for workload balancing and risk alerts

Sources: `prompts/R2-REBUILD-004-MANAGER-FEATURES.md`, `prompts/R2-REBUILD-002-BUSINESS-LOGIC.md`
### Infinite Scrolling for Lists
- Description: Replace explicit "Load more" buttons with automatic fetching when users near the bottom of the list.
- Scope: People and Projects left-panel lists (and similar long lists).
- Approach: Use IntersectionObserver/scroll threshold with React Query `fetchNextPage()`; preserve keyboard accessibility and announce loading status.
- Benefits: Fewer clicks; smoother, continuous browsing.
- Trade-offs: Must guard against over-fetching; keep clear end-of-list indicators; still combine with virtualization for render performance.
- Acceptance: Smooth auto-append, no duplicate loads, accessible focus management, works with filtered views.
- Estimated Timeline: 0.5‚Äì1 day

### Brotli Compression for Nginx
- **Description**: Enable Brotli compression in Nginx for improved asset compression beyond gzip
- **Status**: Deferred due to implementation complexity vs. marginal benefits
- **Current**: Gzip compression already provides ~80% of Brotli's benefits with `gzip_comp_level 6`
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Switch from `nginx:alpine` to `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:alpine` or custom build
  - Add Brotli configuration to `nginx/nginx.conf` (already has placeholder config)
  - Update `nginx/sites-available/workload-tracker.conf` for content negotiation
  - Add build-time pre-compression to frontend Dockerfile
  - Add Brotli CLI tools to build containers
- **Benefits**: 15-20% better compression than gzip (~50-100KB savings on JS/CSS)
- **Complexity**: 5-7 file changes, custom Docker images, build process modifications
- **Alternative**: Consider CDN-based Brotli (e.g., Cloudflare auto-enables Brotli)
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 days
- **Trigger**: When asset sizes grow significantly or CDN migration is planned
