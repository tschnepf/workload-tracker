# My Work Page — Theme Mockups

This folder contains five static HTML mockups of the “My Work” page using blue‑forward themes that align with the SMC triangle logo. Open any `.html` file in a browser to preview.

Files
- `my-work-smc-navy.html` — Deep SMC navy theme
- `my-work-steel-cyan.html` — Deep steel + cyan
- `my-work-triad.html` — Triad gradient accents
- `my-work-midnight.html` — Midnight glass with neon focus
- `my-work-sky.html` — Charcoal with light sky accents
- `my-work-topbar-scheme.html` — Matches the existing UI top bar navy/blue scheme

Team Dashboard (Sky theme variations)
- `team-dashboard-sky-a.html` — Summary (2 cols) + Heatmap, then Team Overview and Available People
- `team-dashboard-sky-b.html` — Metric tiles row + Heatmap grid + Recent Assignments
- `team-dashboard-sky-c.html` — Filters toolbar + Summary + Utilization distribution tiles
- `team-dashboard-sky-d.html` — Split view: Heatmap (2 cols) + Team list (1 col), sticky filters

Notes
- These are static previews meant to convey color, spacing, and emphasis — not functional React pages.
- The header logo references `frontend/public/brand/SMC-TRIANGLE.png`. If you open from the filesystem, use a browser that allows local file references, or adjust the `src` paths if needed.
- Layout mirrors the app: Summary on top; next row is Calendar (2 columns) + Projects (1 column); below are Upcoming Pre‑Deliverables and My Deliverables.
