# Workload Tracker - User Guide

**Professional resource management and workload allocation system**

## üìã Overview

Workload Tracker is a comprehensive team management application designed to help managers efficiently allocate resources, track utilization, and optimize team performance. Built with a dark, professional interface optimized for productivity.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üë• **People Management**
Comprehensive team member management with capacity tracking.

**What you can do:**
- **Add Team Members**: Create profiles with name, weekly capacity (hours), role, and department assignment
- **Edit Team Information**: Update capacity, roles, department assignments, and contact details
- **Track Skills & Expertise**: Tag team members with their strengths, areas for improvement, and current learning goals
- **View Team Directory**: Search and filter team members by name, department, or role
- **Capacity Planning**: Set individual weekly hour capacities (default 36h, customizable 1-80h)

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to **People** in the sidebar
2. Click **"+ New"** to add team members
3. Fill in basic information (name and capacity are required)
4. Assign to departments and add skill tags as needed
5. Use the search bar to quickly find team members


## My Work (Personal Dashboard)

A focused, personal view showing your assignments, upcoming pre-deliverables, near-term schedule, and alerts.

- Where: Sidebar ? "My Work" (`/my-work`) ó visible when enabled by administrators
- What you'll see:
  - Summary: your utilization %, allocated vs available hours for the current week
  - Pre-deliverables: your due/overdue pre-items (e.g., Specs, TOC) with quick complete actions
  - Deliverables: next milestones across your active projects
  - Projects: your projects with next milestone dates
  - Schedule: compact week-by-week capacity strip
- Performance: page prefetches when you hover; second visits are faster due to caching and ETags
- Tips:
  - Link your account to a Person profile (admin can assist) to enable this view
  - Use quick actions to open Assignments and Calendar scoped to you

Administrators
- Toggle availability via `PERSONAL_DASHBOARD` flag (frontend) and feature flags in backend settings
- Capabilities endpoint (`/api/capabilities/`) advertises `personalDashboard: true` for client gating
- Aggregated endpoint: `GET /api/personal/work/` (ETag + short-TTL cache)

------

## Serializer & Naming Discipline

Centralize snake_case ‚Üí camelCase mapping in DRF serializers; avoid hand‚Äëmapping in views.

- Backend: Use serializers for both model and aggregate responses (see `docs/NAMING-DISCIPLINE.md`).
- Frontend: Use typed models in `frontend/src/types/models.ts`; do not manually rename fields in components.

---

## Structured JSON Logs

The backend emits JSON logs for each HTTP request (includes `request_id`, `user_id`, `path`, `status`, and `duration_ms`). Each response also includes an `X-Request-ID` header to correlate with logs and Sentry.

Quick examples:

- Docker (dev):
  - Tail backend logs: `docker compose logs -f backend`
  - Filter request lines only: `docker compose logs -f backend | rg '"logger":"request"'`
  - Pretty-print with `jq` (optional): `docker compose logs -f backend | rg '"logger":"request"' | jq .`

- Kubernetes (example):
  - `kubectl logs -f deploy/workload-tracker-backend | jq .`

Tip: Include `X-Request-ID` on client requests to propagate an external trace ID; otherwise the server generates one.

## üåê Global Department Filter

Apply a department scope across the entire app and share deep links.

- Persistent filter visible in the header. Toggle ‚ÄúInclude sub-departments.‚Äù
- Deep link parameters: `?dept=<id>&deptChildren=0|1` (when unset, params are removed)
- URL precedence on first load; thereafter changes update the URL without adding history entries.
- Keyboard shortcut: Alt+Shift+D to focus the filter from anywhere.
- Pages and APIs automatically respect this filter (People, Assignments, Capacity Heatmap, Workload Forecast).

Tip: Use the ‚ÄúCopy link‚Äù action in the header to share a filtered view.

---

## Administration & Auth

### Authentication Enforcement Toggle (AUTH_ENFORCED)
- Purpose: stage the switch to authenticated APIs during rollout.
- Behavior:
  - When AUTH_ENFORCED=true (default), the backend enforces IsAuthenticated globally.
  - When AUTH_ENFORCED=false, the backend relaxes to AllowAny to support staggered frontend/backend deploys.
- Configure via env (e.g., .env):
  - AUTH_ENFORCED=true for staging/production

### Create a Dev User (local)
Quickly create or update a local account:

`ash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py create_dev_user \
  --username admin --password admin123 --email admin@example.com --staff --superuser
` 

This also ensures a corresponding UserProfile exists via signals.

### Production Safety (Highlights)
- DEBUG=false in production (enforced in docker-compose.prod.yml).
- Set SECRET_KEY, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS via env.
- If behind a proxy/ingress, Django honors X-Forwarded-* headers (SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER, USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST).
