# Remediation SLAs

- Critical: immediate (block release); target: within 24 hours
- High: 48 hours
- Medium: 7 days
- Low: backlog (prioritize in next sprint)

Notes
- Targets are calendars days unless otherwise negotiated. Track exceptions with an accepted-risk record in `security/security-findings.json` (suppression.reason, approver, expires).
- Severity/risk should be recalculated if exposure/impact changes.
